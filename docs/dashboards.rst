GSI Crawler

This dashboard is useful to the analysis of comments from external aplications like Amazon and Foursquare. The user will choose the type of analysis he wants to carry out (Emotions, Sentiments or Fake Analysis) and he will also supply, for instance, a direct URL to a Amazonâ€™s Product. 

GSI Crawler will download the comments belonging to this element and, later, the pertinent analysis will be run using the Senpy tool. Once the analysis is finished, a summary of the result will be shown and the possibility of review each comment one by one will be also offered.

Developing your own dashboard
-----------------------------

In this section we will explain how to create new dashboards in Sefarad, or import existing ones. First of all you must create a new directory inside **elements** (e.g ``elements/my-dashboard``), and move inside all your dashboard files (e.g my-dashboard.html).

Afterwards, you have to create a new tab in left menu inside **index.html** file, and create a new section where your dashboard will be shown.

.. sourcecode:: html

	...
	<a data-route="my_dashboard_route" href="/my_dashboard_route">
    	<iron-icon icon="your_widget_icon"></iron-icon>
    	<span>My Dashboard</span>
	</a>
	...
	<section data-route="my_dashboard_route">
    	<my-dashboard></my-dashboard>
	</section>
	...

In addition, you have to define your dashboard structure as follows in **my-dashboard.html** file.

.. sourcecode:: html

	<dom-module id="my-dashboard">

 	<template>
	  	<!--   dashboard content   -->
 	</template>

	</dom-module>


Inside ``<dom-module>`` tag you have to define your new Polymer dashboard adding some JavaScript:

.. sourcecode:: javascript
	

	Polymer({
		is: 'my-dashboard',
		properties: {
			// dashboard properties
		},
		ready: function(){
			do_some_function();    	
		}
	});     
 

Finally, complete the ``routing.html`` and ``elements.html`` files located inside elements directory.

**routing.html**

.. sourcecode:: javascript

	...
	page('/my_dashboard_route',function(){
	    app.route = 'my_dashboard_route';
	    });
	...

**elements.html**

.. sourcecode:: html

	<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/my_component/my_component.html">
	<link rel="import" href="my-dashboard/index.html">

Remember to add your Polymer Web Components to ``bower_components`` directory if not included yet. Edit css if necessary.

After following these steps, build up Sefarad environment and you should visualize your dashboard successfully.
