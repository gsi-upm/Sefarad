==================================

##Introduction
Sefarad is an application developed to explore data by making SPARQL queries to the endpoint you choose without writing more code. You can also create your own cores if you have a big collection of data ([LMF](https://code.google.com/p/lmf/) required). To view your data you can customize your own widgets and visualize it through them.

##Getting Started 
If you want to easy try Sefarad, just download this repository (cloning it to your computer or downloading it as a .zip) and open in your web browser the file `demo.html` located in the `build /` folder. 

We provide you everything you need to take your first steps in Sefarad through our [European Universities Demo](http://demos.gsi.dit.upm.es/sefarad/index.html#/sparql/universitiesDemo). Visit the [Case Study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ8i2kpGGxs) video to learn more about the demo and the possibilities you have. Summarizing, we have made a SPARQL query for European Universities to [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org/About) (We have set a limit of the results for improved performance). Furthermore, we have include some widgets that allows you to filter those universities by country or city, shows them into a map and show the total number of filtered results.

Of course you may add the widgets you want just clicking _Add widget_ button. 

Let's _play_ with our demo and try yourself the possibilities it brings to you.
